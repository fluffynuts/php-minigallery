<h3>Minigal Class documentation</h3>
<div class="shead">What is this?</div>
<!--  <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
Minigal provides a web gallery class that can also be used as a reqlly quick,
simple, droping web gallery for amateurs. You can include it in your php
file and use the exposed class, or simply reference it directly to have it
display your images in a gallery with thumbnails and a navigation bar.
</div>
<!-- >>> -->
<div class="shead">But why?</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
I wanted a simple gallery php script that could just be dropped into a 
directory and it would, by default, take care of the basics. I also wanted
to make it able to read a config file for ease of configuration, and I wanted
to be able to drive it from the URL, if need be. The minigal.php file
accomplishes all of this. Finally, I wanted to wrap the whole thing as a class
so that someone whose needs are <i>almost</i> met by the drop-in version could
use the class in their own script to make something a little flashier. Also,
a person with some wits could use this class to generate thumbnail images for
some other reason. If they really wished to do so.

<div class="shead">About style and other such things</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
	I tend to do just about all of my coding in VIM. Actually, I stick to using
	the graphical version (GVIM), but sometimes make short trips to the land
	of the console. My reasons are simple: I need a uniform development 
	environment on win32 and linux (because I'm forced to use the first, and
	I love to use the second), and I needed something powerful, yet simple
	and, quite importantly, free. Not just free as in beer -- free as in
	licensing. I believe that the days of closed-source applications are
	over. Commercial apps can still be written: a coder has to eat and feed
	his wife and all that. But your clients deserve disclosure on the source, 
	should you be abducted by aliens or something similar. Or even just so they
	can also hire a hacker to implement features you didn't think of. But
	enough of that.</p>
	<p>Also, whilst VIM may give an initially steep learning curve, and
	seem to contain unnecessary keyboard work, you will find that other
	editors become annoying after you find the true power in vim. Also, very
	few other editors are as ready to adapt to the coder's wishes.</p>
	<p>The point is that you might notice a few commented out &lt;&lt;&lt;'s
	and corresponding &gt;&gt;&gt;'s. This is not an angle-bracket fetish: it's
	my choice for fold markers in vim (thanks to a friend) because curly braces
	cause problems in Tcl (even when commented), and tend to mess up the
	brace-matching for languages that use braces for code blocks, since
	vim cannot always tell what is a code brace, and what is a fold brace.
	You also might notice that I tend to stick to an 80 column line. This can
	make some sections of deep code a little short on space, but it's something
	I do as a matter of style (thanks to the same friend). It makes for
	easier reading on a terminal, and means that the code is more easily
	available to anyone who has time to waste on it.</p>

<div class="shead">Where to begin?</div>
<!--- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
Well, the simplest case would be top drop this into a directory containing
images, and just browse to the php file. As long as you still call it 
minigal.php, the script detects that it is being run as such, and goes
into a &quot;self-contrained&quot; mode, generating the thumbnails,
navigation and display all by itself. You can alter this default behaviour
by feeding arguments on the URL, or in a file called minigal_conf.php,
to be found in the same directory as the script that is loaded from
the url. We'll examine these two approaches separately. First, let's have
a look at the possible variables and values that can be given to minigal.php.
</p>
</div>
<!-- >>> -->
<div class="shead">Control variables</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
	Most of the method interface to the minigal class are achieved through
	arrays of arguments. Simply because it allows you to specify whatever 
	arguments you want to specify, in whatever order you want. Kind of like
	the way Python works. This means that you will often see the following
	kind of method call:
	<div class="codeblock"><code>
	$obj->method(array(<br>
		"index1"		=>	"value1", <br>
		"index2"		=>	"value2",<br>
	));
	</code>
	</div><p>
	When I refer to arguments by name, you will be specifying them like this.
	You can, of course, define the array before doing the method call, and just
	give the array as the only argument  -- I just think that the code is 
	clearer the first way.</p>
	<p>This also means that the _GET array can be treated as an instantiation
	array for the class -- and in fact, this is what happens when you use
	minigal in a self-contrained manner (check out the code at the end of
	the class file, if you don't believe me).</p>
	<p>Possible setting values are:
	<table align="center">
		<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Influence</th><th>Default</th></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>title</td>
			<td>The title of the gallery page to be created.
			</td>
			<td>Image gallery</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<td>dir</td>
			<td>The directory to look at to generate the gallery for. Must
				be a dir that the script can actually read from, and may
				just be a relative directory. So if you had three galleries,
				you could show them all separately with links like:
				<code>
				&lt;a href=&quot;minigal.php?dir=dir1&quot;&gt;Gallery 1&lt;a&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;minigal.php?dir=dir2&quot;&gt;Gallery 2&lt;a&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;minigal.php?dir=dir3&quot;&gt;Gallery 3&lt;a&gt;
				</code>
				in your main page where you tell people about why they should
				look at your galleries  (:
			</td>
			<td>current dir (.)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>thumb_l</td>
			<td>length of the longest side for thumbnail images, measured
				in pixels (leave off the px)</td>
			<td>100</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>disp_l</td>
			<td>length of the longest side, for the displayed image.</td>
			<td>Not set -- defaults to let images be their natural size.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>timg</td>
			<td>Image to generate a thumbnail of -- may even be a remote
				image. If timg is specified, then the class <i>only</i> makes
				that thumbnail inline, and no gallery -- this is how minigal
				makes her thumbnails, with self-references.</td>
			<td>Not set. Don't set unless you really want an inline image.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>css</td>
			<td>path to a stylesheet to include, if required. Note that if
				a default.css is found in the current path, it is included 
				in addition to this file.
			</td>
			<td>Not set</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>thumbs_w</td>
			<td>Width of thumbs navigation sidebar, in pixels.</td>
			<td>200 -- works quite well.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>thumbs_h</td>
			<td>Height of thumbs navigation sidebar, in pixels.</td>
			<td>450</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>thumbs_top</td>
			<td>Top of thumbs navigation sidebar, in pixels. Note that
				the sidebar and display image are positioned absolutely,
				so this makes a big difference.</td>
			<td>10</td>
		</td>
		<tr>
			<td>heading</td>
			<td>Short heading text to be found in the heading area, above the
				thumbs navigator. Because of absolute sizing and positioning,
				you want to keep this quite short to prevent text overrunning
				the heading box.
			</td>
			<td>Gallery</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>show_fnames</td>
			<td>Boolean as to whether or not to show image file names under 
				the relevant image. Possible vallues are 1 and 0</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>selected</td>
			<td>Name of selected file.</td>
			<td>First image file in gallery directory</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>disp_top</td>
			<td>Absolute position, in pixels of top of display area.</td>
			<td>Defaults to align with the top of the heading box.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>thumbs_l</td>
			<td>Absolute position, in pixels of left of thumbs navigation
				box. </td>
			<td>20</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>thumb_title_height</td>
			<td>Tweak to help with positioning the thumbs navigator such that
				the currently selected image thumbnail is visible in the
				navigator box. Basically, this is the height, in pixels,
				that is accounted for for the filename line, if there is
				one. If you find that the re-alignment is sifficently off, 
				then you can alter this number to help out.</td>
			<td>18</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>tip_delay</td>
			<td>time, in milliseconds, that the hovering dhtml tips should
				stay onscreen for, until disappearing</td>
			<td>5000</td>
		</tr>

<div class="shead">Specifying the variables</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
You can specify the above variables as elements in an array given to the
class to instantiate itself with (when you are using the class in another
php script) or on the URL line (when using the class in self-contrained mode).
You may also include them in the minigal_conf.php file, which is looked for
by minigal irrespective of whether or not the file is self-contrained.
</p>
<p>Examples:
<ol><li>URL
<div class="codeblock">
<code>
	http://myserver.com/galleries/minigal.php?dir=cats_and_dogs&amp;title=Cats+and+Dogs&amp;heading=Soooo+Cute
</code>
</div>
</li>
<li>instantiating the class within php code
<div class="codeblock">
<code>
	$mygal=new Minigal(array(<br>
	"dir"	=&gt;	"cats_and_dogs",<br>
	"title"	=&gt;	"Cats and Dogs",<br>
	"heading" =&gt;	"Soooo cute",<br>
	));
</code>
</div>
</li>
<li>the minigal_conf.php file
<div class="codeblock">
<code>
	&lt;?php<br>
	$options = array(<br>
	"dir"	=&gt;	"cats_and_dogs",<br>
	"title"	=&gt;	"Cats and Dogs",<br>
	"heading" =&gt;	"Soooo cute",<br>
	);<br>
	?&gt;
</code>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!-- >>> -->
<div class="shead">Tooltip texts</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
As an added feature, you can add dhtml tooltips to your images, with text about
the image, which may be quite nice for your visitors. This can be done in 
php code by manually setting the titles and texts member arrays of the
instantiated minigal class:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>
$mygal = new Minigal();<br>
$mygal-&gt;titles=array(<br>
&quot;img1.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;First image&quot;,<br>
&quot;img2.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;Second image&quot;,<br>
);
$mygal-&gt;texts=array(<br>
&quot;img1.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;This is the first image that I created&quot;,<br>
&quot;img2.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;This is a picture of my cat!&quot;,<br>
);
</code>
</div>
or, when using the minigal_conf.php file, by setting the same arrays in code:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>
&lt;?php<br>
$titles=array(<br>
&quot;img1.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;First image&quot;,<br>
&quot;img2.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;Second image&quot;,<br>
);<br>
$texts=array(<br>
&quot;img1.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;This is the first image that I created&quot;,<br>
&quot;img2.jpg&quot; =&gt; &quot;This is a picture of my cat!&quot;,<br>
);<br>
?&gt;
</code>
</div>
Texts and titles cannot be set on the URL -- besides, a lot of browsers can't
handle a url line longer than 2000 characters, which would limit the usefulness
of such an approach.
</p>
</div>
<!-- >>> -->
<div class="shead">Usage</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
Usage of the gallery is quite intuitive -- the browsing individual can
either select an image from the thumbnail navigator, or use the navigation
buttons to go (in order) to the first image, the previous image, the next
image or the last image. Also, since the images are loaded with Javascript,
the user is given an indication of what the gallery is doing with red status
text below the navigation buttons. Neat, eh? And all in one file -- no
inclusion of this, that, and the next file, no dependencies. Woot!
